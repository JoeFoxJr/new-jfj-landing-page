        <p>My name is Joe.  I wear a lot of different hats.</p>
        <p>I'm a product person, project manager, engineer, athlete, musician, gamer, nerd, and more.  I grew up outside of Boston, studied mechanical engineering and physics at UMass Amherst, and am now pursuing a career as a product manager while living in New York City with my amazing girlfriend, <a href="https://www.med.nyu.edu/sackler/mdphd-program/mstp-trainees/kristina-boguslawski" target="_blank">Kristina</a>.</p>

        <h2>Robotics</h2>
        <p>I have over 3 years of experience managing projects in the field of robotics.  I have led various types of projects, ranging from the development and adoption of a new ticketing system to the deployment of large-scale robotic systems with capital costs in excess of $60M.</p>
        <br/>
        <h2>Coding</h2>
        <p>I consider myself to be a lifelong learner and am always working on expanding my knowledge and skillset.  While I have no real experience or training in computer science, I have taught myself some basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery and I like to test out my web development skills from time to time.  See below for some of my projects:</p>
        <h4>joepoem.com</h4>
        <p>A small website for sharing short-form poetry<p>
        <h4>calculator.joefoxjr.com</h4>
        <p>A work in progress!</p>
        <h4>legacy.joefoxjr.com</h4>
        <p>A website that I made back in 2011 while teaching myself html &amp; css.</p>

        <h2>Volunteerism</h2>
        <p>While a student at UMass Amherst I took part in a number of charity events, including a cross-country cycling trip for which I raised over $9,000.  All proceeds went directly to organizations that serve people with disabilities.</p>
